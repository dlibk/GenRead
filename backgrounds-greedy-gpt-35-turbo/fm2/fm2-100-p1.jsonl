This property is a fundamental aspect of the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles.\n\n**Mass of a Photon**\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, a particle with zero rest mass, such as the photon, must always travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. This is because the energy of a particle with mass increases as its velocity approaches the speed of light, making it impossible for a massive particle to reach or exceed the speed of light. Since photons travel at the speed of light, they must have zero rest mass.\n\n**Experimental Evidence**\n\nExperimental evidence supporting the masslessness of photons comes from a variety of sources, including high-energy particle collisions and astronomical observations. For example, the behavior of photons in particle accelerators and cosmic rays is consistent with the predictions of a massless particle. Additionally, the gravitational lensing of light around massive objects, such as galaxies and black holes, also supports the idea that photons have no mass.\n\n**Implications of Massless Photons**\n\nThe masslessness of photons has significant implications for our understanding of the universe. For instance, the fact that photons have no mass allows them to travel over vast distances without being significantly affected by gravitational forces. This property is essential for"]}
